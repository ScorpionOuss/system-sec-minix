## How to test our tool
    1.  Build Minix
    2.  Login as root
    3.  Run the binary /usr/games/demo01 
        -> It should run without any issues, since it has valid signatures
    4.  Run the binary /usr/games/demo02 
        -> It was modified after signing, should be killed before it has executed

DONE!

## Generate Signatures
    1. Build the file generate_signatures.c with gcc
    2. Run it with binaries that you want to sign as arguments
        -> These can be found in the obj-folder generated when you build minix
    3. The output will be put into minix/servers/csc/signatures.h

DONE!
